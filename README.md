## Overview

The **Mock News Analyzer** is a Java-based system designed to simulate a real-time news feed and analyze incoming news
items. It consists of two main components:

- **Mock News Feed**: Generates and sends randomized news headlines with assigned priority levels over a TCP connection.
- **News Analyzer**: Receives incoming news messages, filters relevant ones based on sentiment analysis, and
  periodically summarizes the most important news.

The project demonstrates **real-time data processing** using **TCP communication**, **multi-threading**, and
**data generation**. The system can handle multiple concurrent news feeds and provides periodic reports
on significant news trends.

## Architecture and Components

The system consists of the following core components:

![](./docs/images/design.png)

### **Mock News Feed (Client)**

- **Purpose**: Generates and sends randomized news items to the News Analyzer.
- **Core Functionality**:
    - Generates random news headlines using predefined keywords.
    - Assigns priority levels to news items based on a given probability distribution.
    - Sends news items to the Server over a persistent TCP connection.
    - Supports automatic reconnection if the connection is lost.
    - Configurable message sending interval through Java properties.

### **News Analyzer (Server)**

- **Purpose**: Receives and processes news messages from the Mock News Feed clients.
- **Core Functionality**:
    - Listens for incoming client connections over TCP.
    - Manages concurrent client connections efficiently using multi-threading.
    - Stores data into efficient sorted data structure.
    - Filters incoming news based on sentiment analysis.
    - Aggregates and summarizes positive news every 10 seconds.

### **Common Module**

- **Purpose**: Provides shared utilities, functionalities, and DTOs for both services.

## How to Build and Run the Project

### Step 1: Configure Properties

Set the following environment variables in the deployment script (`start.bat` or `start.sh`):

| Environment Variable                   | Description                                                                                                 | Default Value |
|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------|
| `SERVER_PORT`                          | News Analyzer Server reserved port. Ensure it is available on your machine. Used by both server and client. | `5001`        |
| `SERVER_HOST`                          | Server host: used by the client to connect to the server.                                                   | `localhost`   |
| `SERVER_CONNECTIONS_POOL_SIZE`         | Server connections pool size. Also determines the number of deployed client instances.                      | `5`           |
| `CLIENT_MESSAGE_SCHEDULER_INTERVAL_MS` | Interval for scheduled task that sends messages to the server in the client app (in milliseconds).          | `2000`        |

### Step 2: Deployment

#### Start Services

There is a deployment script (`start.bat` for Windows, `start.sh` for Unix-based systems) to clean, build the project
using Maven, and then deploy the server and client instances.

- After script execution, you should have **one server** and **multiple clients** running.
- The script opens a terminal window for each running instance to monitor logs.
    - **Server instance window title**: `NewsAnalyzerServer` - Logs:
    - **Client instance window title**: `MockNewsClient_*` (with instance number appended).

#### Logs

Once server and clients are started you should see similar logs:

Client:

```log
02:00:29.538 [main] INFO  d.t.t.m.client.MockNewsClient - Attempting to connect to News Analyzer Server at localhost:5001
02:00:29.547 [main] INFO  d.t.t.m.client.MockNewsClient - Successfully connected to the server.

02:00:37.548 [pool-1-thread-1] INFO  d.t.t.m.client.MockNewsClient - Sent news item: down good unter;1
```

Server:

```log

02:00:38.467 [pool-1-thread-1] INFO  d.t.t.s.task.NewsSummaryReporter - Priority: 1, Headline: down Ã¼ber rise
```

#### Stop the Services

A shutdown script (`stop.bat`, `stop.sh`) is available to terminate all running application instances.

#### Notes

- Only the Windows batch scripts have been tested.

## Future Improvements

- Improve project configurability to control the resources up to what the host machine can handle.
- Write more integration (end-to-end) tests alongside the written unit tests.
- Improve deployment strategy using Docker and Docker Compose.
- Improve logs streaming into files.
- Implement rate limiter for TCP connections.
- Improve data serialization/deserialization on transmission over the network.
